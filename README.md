# mini Notepad
This Mini Notepad project is a console-based application built in C++ that demonstrates the use of core Data Structures through a simple note-taking system. The program allows users to add notes, display all saved notes, undo or redo recent actions, browse predefined categories, and search notes using keywords. Internally, the project implements a Linked List for storing notes dynamically, making insertion efficient and flexible. To manage user actions, Stacks are used for Undo and Redo operations following the LIFO principle. A fixed Array stores note categories, while a HashMap (unordered_map) provides fast O(1) keyword-based searching. Together, these structures create a functional and educational demonstration of how Data Structures work in real applications. The project is simple, efficient, and ideal for beginners learning how to combine different DS concepts in a single program
